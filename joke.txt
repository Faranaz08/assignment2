 The Talking Frog
An engineer was crossing a road one day when a frog called out to him

If you kiss me I will turn into a beautiful princess said the frog

He bent over picked up the frog and put it in his pocket

The frog then cried out If you kiss me and turn me back into a princess  I will stay with you for one week and do ANYTHING you want

Again the engineer took the frog out smiled at it and put it back into his pocket

What is the matter the frog asked I have told you I am a beautiful princess and that Ill stay with you for one week and do anything you want Why won't you kiss me?"
